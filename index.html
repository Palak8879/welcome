  <h1>CIS1250 Writing Assignments</h1>
  <p>Software design is used by programmers all around the world due to its various uses that aid people in their day-to-day 
    lives. Software design serves an important purpose in our lives today because well-designed systems improve and boost 
    speed and efficiency, saving time and allowing the user a higher comfort level. Well-thought-out designs are also able 
    to weed out and fix potential errors early on, and they increase reliability in the process. This significantly optimizes 
    resources so that they can be of use later down the road and reduce long-term costs as well. Although I've used several 
    different and equally unique software throughout the past few years that I've been programming, the one that I think
    was designed particularly well was Replit. Replit is software that possesses various great qualities and features 
    that make it one of the best choices among programmers at all levels of mastery. To begin with, Replit contains 
    a user-friendly interface, which is incredibly helpful for beginners as it allows them to start coding, even if 
    they have little to no background knowledge of programming. Along with this, it also has many tools that help boost 
    newcomers’ performances. An example of this would be the various tutorials and templates it offers to whoever it is 
    that may need it, which makes it easier for people to reach out and get the support they need. In addition to this, 
    it also allows for collaboration in real time through the use of its invite feature that lets the user add people 
    that they would like to work with, which makes Replit an amazing tool for coding together, as well as group projects 
    in general. In conclusion, Replit is an amazing example of well-designed software as it emphasizes the rudimentary 
    principles of proper software design by primarily being made up of features that bolster cooperation and usability. </p>
  <p>Good software design processes begin once requirements have been gathered, as they are crucial in ensuring that 
    the software can perform its main function efficiently. To begin with, requirements are specific operations 
    that the software must perform since they clearly and concisely describe what the client needs the software 
    to do. The requirement-gathering stage is crucial for the design process because it helps us understand 
    the problem the software must be able to solve, and what the user’s needs are. This first stage is the foundation 
    for all the upcoming stages of the development cycle. Although this is a difficult process, it is highly necessary, 
    as it helps clarify which requirements must be prioritized. By doing this we can prevent misunderstandings 
    and thus ensure that all expectations that the client specified have been met. Good and proper requirements must 
    be clear and concise, measurable, traceable, prioritized, as well as testable. In conclusion, through efficient 
    requirement gathering, we not only devise a clear guide for the entire development process but confirm that the 
    final outcome of the project lines up with the client’s expectations as well as the user’s needs.</p>
  <p>User stories for Replit: 
     1. As a user, I want an invite button present in each program, so that I am able to collaborate with my peers. 
     2. As a user, I want to be able to watch tutorials that help me learn how to navigate the software, so that I 
     am able to use it in an efficient manner. 
     3. As a user, I want to be able to change the theme and template of my programs, so that I can make personalized 
     projects. 
     4. As a user, I want to be able to sort my programs into different folders, so that I can stay organized.
     5. As a user, I want to be able to rename my programs whenever I want, so that I can easily find the program I 
     am looking for if I need to refer back to one of my projects in the future. </p>
